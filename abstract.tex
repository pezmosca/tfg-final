	Ubiquitous applications have already become a constant in daily life. Especially smartphones applications. Every day new applications appear and get integrated into the environment of the person, appearing anywhere and at any time. This fact generates new challenges for developers, such as the detection and monitoring of errors that may occur in such applications.
	\\
	Today's ubiquitous applications can run on a large number of devices, this project will focus on smartphones and especially those that run Android.
	\\
	This project aims to bring to the company a system for monitoring and detect errors in ubiquitous devices by designing, implementing and deploying the different parts of that system.
